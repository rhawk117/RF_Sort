# Algo Viewer
In preparation for Data Structures Exam 2 I decided to make a UI in conjuction with the algorithms provided for us. For each of the sorting algorithms that were provided in the code there is a guided UI
that gives the Steps, Description, Time Complexity and Worst Case Input. Additionally, you can generate random lists to view how the algorithm works or altneratively type in your own custom
list to try and solve a pronlem yourself. I find this particularly useful when trying to do practice problems in preparation for the exam or when I need to refresh on either the steps or the time complexities of each
I hope this is helpful, best of luck on Exam 2.

NOTE: I did not write any of the Print methods for the algorithms nor did I make any of the code in the Sort class I only made slight alterations
so the UI would work. These were created by Professor Dowell and I did not make them and made this program as a fun way to learn about each of the algorithms
